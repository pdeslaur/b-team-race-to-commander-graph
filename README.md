# B-Team Race To Commander Graph
----
## Context
Two of my favorite youtubers ([@bdoubleo100](twitter.com/bdoubleo100) and [@generikb](twitter.com/generikb)) are racing to level 55 in COD Black Ops II. A plain old race you might think? Not so much! The loser will be filmed wearing a dress, walking down the street, and upload it to youtube.[^1]

## A simple Graph
This is basically a graph built using [D3](http://d3js.org/) to show off the progress of each player. Most of the code comes from [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884914).

The graph is currently hosted [here](bteam-race.deslauriers.me)
